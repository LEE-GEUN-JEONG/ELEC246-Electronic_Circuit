♣ Problem 9.5 (Ans : Solution 참고)<br>
(a) AM = Vi/Vo = -gmRD, So RD = 10Kohm<br>
(b) fP = (gm+1/Rs)/2pi*Cs, So Cs = 3.53uF<br>
(c) fz = 1/(2pi*CsRs), So fz = 10Hz<br>
(d) since fP >> fZ, fL = fP = 100Hz<br>
(e) DCgain = -RD / (1/gm +Rs) = -2 V/V<br><br>

♣ Problem 9.10 (Ans : Solution 참고)<br>
(a) AM= -aRC/re+Re and fL=fP=1/(2piCE(re+Re))<br>
(b) |AM|=(aRC/re)(1/(1+Re/re)) Thus, including R, reduces the gain magnitude by the factor (1+Re/re)<br>
(c) fL=1/2piCEre*1/(1+Re/re) Thus, including R, reduces fL by the factor (1+Re/re). So Re can be used to tradeoff gain for decreasing fL<br>
(d) I=0.25mA, RC=19kohm, CL=10uF, re=100ohm, for Re=0, |AM|=aRC/re=100V/V<br>
fL=159.2Hz to lower fL by a factor of 10, we use 1+Re/re=10 So Re=900ohm. the gain now becomes |AM}=10V/V<br><br>

♣ Problem 9.15 (Ans : Solution 참고)	<br>
fT = gm/(2pi(Cgs+Cgd)), for Cgs >> Cgd, fT = gm/2piCgs, Cgs = 2/3 * WLCox + WLovCox<br>
if the overlap component (WLovCox) is small. we get Cgs=2/3WLCox. the transconductance gm is givien by gm = root(2unCox(W/L)ID<br>
fT = (root(2unCox(W/L)ID)/2pi*2/3WLCox<br>
we obseerve that for a given device. fT is proportional to root(ID), thus to obtain faster operation the MOSFET is operated at a higher ID.<br>
Also, we observe that fT is inversely proportional to Lroot(WL), thus faster operation is obtained from smaller devices.<br><br>

♣ Problem 9.19 (Ans : Solution 참고)<br>
rx=100ohm,gm=40mA/V, rpi=2.5Kohm, ro=50Kohm, Cde=1.2pF, Cje0=20pF<br>
So, Cpi=1.24pF, Cu=10.4fF, fT=5.1GHz<br>
