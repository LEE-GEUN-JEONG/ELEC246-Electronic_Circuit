♣ Problem 8.42 (Ans : Solution 참고)<br>
Both circuits have the same differential half-circuit<br>
Thus, Ad=(aRc)/(re+Re)<br>
Rid=(b+1)(2re+2Re)<br>
with vid=0, the dc voltage appearing at the top end of the bias current source will be<br>
1. VCM-VBE-(1/2)RC<br>
2. VCM-VBE<br>
Since circuit 2 results in a larger voltage across the current source and given that the minimum value of VCM is limited by the need to keep a certain specified minimum voltage across the current source, we see that circuit 2 will allow a larger megative VCM<br>
<br>
♣ Problem 8.51 (Ans : Solution 참고)<br>
(a) Assume vid=0 and the two sides of the differential amp are matched.<br>
thus ID1=ID2=0.5mA, So VOV=0.632V<br>
VCM=VGS+1mA*RSS=2.332V<br><br>

(b) gm=1.58mA/V, So RD=5.06Kohm<br><br>

(c) VD1=VD2=VDD-IDRD=2.47V<br><br>

(d) delta VD1/delta VCM = -RD/(1/gm+2RSS) = -1.92V/V<br><br>

(e) For Q1 and Q2 to enter the triode region VCM + deltaVCM=Vt+VD1+delta VD1<br>
So, delta VCM=0.287V with this change, VCM=2.619V and VD1,2=1.919V, thus VCM=Vt+VD1,2<br><br>

♣ Problem 8.74 (Ans : Solution 참고)<br>
(a) RC1=5.2Kohm<br>
RC2=4.8Kohm<br>
to equalize the total resistance in each collector, we adjust the potentiomeher so that x= 0.3Kohm<br><br>

(b) it the area of Q1 and hence IS1 is 5% larger than nominal then we have IS1=1.05IS and <br>
the area of Q2 and hence IS2 is 5% smaller than nominal IS2=0.95IS<br>
Thus, IS1=0.525mA, IS2-0.475mA<br>
Assuming alpha = 1, we obtain IC1=0.525mA, IC2=0.475mA<br>
To reduce the resulting offset to zero, we adjust the potentimeter so that VC1=VC2. SO x=0.225<br>
