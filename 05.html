♣ Problem 9.40 (Ans : Solution 참고)<br>
(r(pi)*(1/gm))/r(pi)+1/gm = r(pi)/(gmr(pi)+1)=re<br>
thus the equivalent circuit simplifies to that of re in parallel with C(pi)<br>
Zi(s)=re/(1+sC(pi)re)<br>
Zi(jw)=re/(1+jwC(pi)re)<br>
Zi(jw) will have a 45(degree) phase at w45C(pi)re = 1<br>
Now, fr=gm/2(pi)*(Cpi + Cu), fT = 1/2pic(pi)re<br>
thus f45(Degree)=fT=400MHz<br>
if the bias current is reduced to the value that results in Cpi = Cu<br>
fT=gm/4piCpi, again gm=1/re, thus f45(degree) = 200MHz<br><br>

♣ Problem 9.47 (Ans : Solution 참고)<br>
(a) A(s) = 1000*1/(1+s/(2pi*10^5))<br>
(b) x축=f, y축=|A|,dB이고 0<=f<=100kHz 일때 |A|=60, 100kHz<=f<=100MHz 일때 일차함수(f=100kHz-->|A|=60, f=100MHz-->|A|=0)<br>
(c) GB = 100MHz<br>
(d) the unity-gain frequency fT is 100MHz<br>
(e) the magnitude response when a second pole at 1MHz appears in the transfer function. The unity-gain frequency ft now is<br>
ft= 10MHz<br>
which is different from the gain-bandwidth product, GB=100MHz<br>
